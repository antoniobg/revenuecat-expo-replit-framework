## Contributing

### You can do this!
We've tagged a number of issues as [you can do this!](/../../labels/you%20can%20do%20this%21). These will generally not require much (or any!) working knowledge of our SDK.

If you decide you want to help, that [you can do this!](/../../labels/you%20can%20do%20this%21) tag is a good place to start. Now, here's how you can actually get going:

- Follow the directions from [2. Create a fork/branch.](#2-create-a-forkbranch) to setup your environment.
- Find an issue that speaks to you, and comment in it "I've got this" or something like that ðŸ˜„.
- If the issue isn't clear enough, feel free to tag in sdk team `@RevenueCat/sdk` asking for clarification.
- Work on the issue! 
- If that builds, then follow [the final steps (Create a pull request to RevenueCat)](#5-create-a-pull-request-to-revenuecatmain-and-request-review)
- Done!
